Hi i created this project Watching a youtuber's video.
The reason i have uploaded this on Github is that initially  i was not able to use functions like lower,replace on my defined function take command
but then i realised these functions only work on string so i converted the function into str.I know this is really basic but i hope even a single person can find it helpful.
